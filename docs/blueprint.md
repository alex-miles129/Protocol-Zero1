## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep crimson (#8B0000), evoking a sense of danger and intensity associated with the 'crime' theme. It avoids being overly aggressive.
- Background color: Dark grey (#2B2B2B), providing a stark backdrop to make the crimson accents pop.
- Accent color: Desaturated Gold (#B8860B) for buttons and interactive elements. Used sparingly, gold highlights importance without distracting.
- Use a modern sans-serif font for headings (e.g., Montserrat, Open Sans) and a readable sans-serif font for body text (e.g., Lato, Roboto).
- Use Font Awesome or similar icon library for menu items and buttons.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear visual hierarchy. Ensure responsiveness across different devices.
- Implement subtle hover effects on navigation links and buttons to provide feedback to the user.
